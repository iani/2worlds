title: Installation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Two Worlds installation curated by Yiannis Colakides avoids pictorial descriptions and monosemantic references to emotions in its search to evoke a participatory experience that distances itself from the aesthetisation of suffering. The visitors of the site on http://larigot.avarts.ionio.gr/projects/2worlds/ and the installation at the NeMe Arts Centre are invited to enter in dialogue and to explore sound recordings gradually through a system that connects and transforms them.
