The recent global developments such as the current rise of militarised violence in 51 United Nations member states has catapulted the number of forcibly displaced people, now exceeding 59,500,000 â€” almost three times more to the numbers in 2014 being the highest number ever recorded. Within this tragic context and existential urgency, Two Worlds has now become an, albeit small, contribution toward the compassionate understanding and support of displaced people.

On September 2, the widely circulated photographs of the drowned toddler who was trying to enter Europe with his family shocked the world. On the same day, Nicholas Mirzoef twitted: "The photo of the drowned toddler from Kos is a pieta for the era of militarized financial globalization." Accepting that media coverage of conflict and human suffering is fraught with ethical problems, the consequential absence of further images of the dead from conflict zones and within Europe - such as the 71 refugees who suffocated in the back of a track in Austria renders other's suffering remote with the intended outcome of keeping public opinion muted in order to prevent additional instigation of much needed change and action, or perhaps and equally disturbing, indicating compassion fatigue.
